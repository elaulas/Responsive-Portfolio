            <p id="bio">Hello, I am Elaulas Cristiano. Currently I live in Keller, Texas but I was born and raised in a small farm town
                in Kansas. Growing up in Kansas was a great experience, we worked for everything we had and simply put, life
                seemed much simpler. I consider myself fortunate to have grown up in a time when we played outside rather
                than staring at phone screens all day. Sports consumed most of my life which lead me to Kansas State University
                to play basketball.
                <br>
                <br> I attended KSU for two year before feeling that my life was not heading in a good direction. I decided to
                go to the United States Navy in search of the structure and direction that my life was missing. In the Navy
                I was a Radiation Health Physics Technician for five year. Though the work was tough and the days were long,
                i spent the early part of my 20's traveling the world. This was a time that I would never replace.
                <br>
                <br> Since my time in the Navy I have completed my undergraduates degree and continued on to obtain an MBA. Currently
                I work as a Marketing and Development Director for the Boy Scouts of America. Though this role has given
                me some great professional experiences, I am reading to follow my dream to work in software engineering.</p>
